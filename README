Abstract
---------
The task was to create a bag of-words based 
matching/categorization solution on the MNIST-fashion
database [1]. We created a global descriptor for each of the images. The
descriptor was inspired from the HOG descriptor. Each descriptor was
treated as a feature, and then k-means clustering was used to find the
cluster centers which represented our visual words, from which a visual
dictionary was created. Using the visual dictionary, histograms were created 
for all the training and test images by using soft-assignment (weights
were assigned to all the visual words based on the distance of that word
from the image feature). Then for each test image, we matched the histogram of the 
test image with all the histograms of the training images
using chi-squared distance. A fixed number of training images (50 chosen empirically) 
whose histogram had the minimum distance from test
histogram were considered, each of those labels were considered and the
label which had the majority vote was taken as the predicted label. We
achieved an accuracy of 81.13% on the test set which can be considered
as a good result considering only traditional computer vision techniques,
and no ML based pipeline.

Running
-----------
Open matlab, navigate to this folder.
Call RunAll_2015CSB1032() in the command window.
Make sure the data files are present in the same folder.
Keep he csv files in the same folder if present. You can download the precomputer csv file from here :
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_lzdbRctAD_ZUxNYjJBdWYyRDA/view?usp=sharing

The images corresponding to the closest words to the cluster centers would be generated in words folder.
Make sure the words folder is created, otherwise an error would occur in between.
